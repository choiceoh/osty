# Osty

A work-in-progress implementation of the **Osty** programming language — a
general-purpose, statically-typed, GC'd language specified in
[`LANG_SPEC_v0.3/`](./LANG_SPEC_v0.3/README.md) with grammar fixed in
[`OSTY_GRAMMAR_v0.3.md`](./OSTY_GRAMMAR_v0.3.md).

The target is transpilation to Go. Current scope: front-end
(lex → parse → resolve → type-check), multi-file packages and
workspaces, formatter, linter, a JSON-RPC LSP server, a Go
transpiler with **Phases 1–6 wired end-to-end** (primitives,
control flow, structs/enums/match, generics/closures,
Option/Result/`?`, `use`/FFI, channels/concurrency), project
scaffolding (`osty new` / `osty init`), a manifest-driven build
orchestrator (`osty build`) that reads `osty.toml` / `osty.lock`
and threads the front-end + gen across the declared packages, a
working test runner (`osty test`), API documentation generation
(`osty doc`), CI quality tooling (`osty ci`), and a package manager
(`osty add` / `osty update` / `osty publish`) backed by a
file-backed HTTP registry server for local/private registries. The
remaining pieces are Tier 2+ of the standard library; the checker now
records generic call instantiations, validates structural interface
satisfaction, emits match exhaustiveness diagnostics, and wires the
auto-derived builder/default protocol.

## Status

| CI quality tooling (`internal/ci`, `osty ci`) | done — signature-aware snapshots, workspace coverage, JSON reports |
| Pipeline visualizer (`osty pipeline`) | done — per-stage timing, workspace mode, package-mode gen, baseline diff, LSP trace, `--explain` |
| Package registry backend / `osty registry serve` | done — file-backed HTTP server for index/search/download/publish/yank, with ETag index responses and bearer-token write auth |
| Build orchestrator (`osty build`) | wired — drives manifest → front-end → gen Phase 1 |
| Test runner harness (`internal/testgen`) | wired — merges per-file gen output, injects a real std.testing runtime + main(), runs via `go run` |
| `osty test` (discovery + front-end + execution) | wired — validates and **runs** discovered `test*` / `bench*` fns; failures and pass/fail totals report inline |
| Package registry / `osty add` / `osty update` / `osty run` | done (resolve + vendor + lockfile-honoring re-resolves, ETag-cached registry index, copy fallback for symlink-less filesystems; CLI: `add`, `remove`/`rm`, `update`, `run`, `fetch`, `publish`, `search`, `info`, `yank`/`unyank`, `login`/`logout`; `--locked` / `--frozen` CI guards) |
| Package manager (`osty add` / `osty update`, path + git + registry sources, SemVer resolver, deterministic lockfile) | wired — `add` mutates `osty.toml` and re-vendors; `update` re-resolves selectively or in full |
| `osty run` (build + exec through gen Phase 1) | wired — resolves manifest, vendors deps, transpiles entry, `go run`s the output with profile/target-aware flags |
| `osty publish` (pack + upload tarball to a registry) | wired — deterministic gzipped tar, sha256 checksum, bearer-auth POST; `--dry-run` stops before upload |

The front-end (lex → parse → resolve) is **spec-complete for v0.3**:
every syntactic construct in `LANG_SPEC_v0.3/` has a positive-corpus
fixture that parses cleanly, and every reject-rule has a negative
fixture that triggers the expected `Exxxx` diagnostic. See
[`ERROR_CODES.md`](./ERROR_CODES.md) for the full code index.

### Type-checker gaps

The checker covers the common path (literals, operators, collections,
functions, patterns, control flow, field access, method dispatch,
Option/Result, closures, type aliases) and now closes the major static
guarantee hooks: generic call instantiation records for the transpiler,
structural interface satisfaction including composed interfaces, match
exhaustiveness (`E0731`) with witnesses for closed shapes, method
references as values, and auto-derived `default()` / builder flows.

Minor deferred items are deliberately conservative rather than absent:
some built-in marker-interface derivations are accepted optimistically
outside primitives, open scalar match domains still require a catch-all,
and type-level generic specialization remains less precise than
function-call monomorphization.

### Transpiler phases

`internal/gen` is wired up as the `osty gen FILE` subcommand.
Phases 1–6 are all implemented end-to-end (see commit
`4829685` "gen/check: finish phases 4–6 for end-to-end CLI
usability"). Remaining unimplemented corners of each phase still
emit a `/* TODO(phaseN): ... */` marker so the produced Go file
type-checks where possible. Phase scope, per `internal/gen/doc.go`:

- **Phase 1** ✓ primitive literals/operators, user fn declarations,
  let bindings, if / for / return, list literals, print intrinsics
- **Phase 2** ✓ structs, enums, interfaces, type aliases, match, patterns
- **Phase 3** ✓ generics, closures, collection methods
- **Phase 4** ✓ Option / Result, `?` operator, defer
- **Phase 5** ✓ `use` declarations, Go FFI
- **Phase 6** ✓ channels, concurrency primitives

```

Global flags (precede the subcommand):

- `--no-color` / `--color` — force disable/enable ANSI output
- `--max-errors N` — stop printing after the first N diagnostics
- `--json` — emit diagnostics as NDJSON on stderr (for tooling)
- `--strict` — `lint`-only: exit 1 on any warning (CI mode)
- `--scopes` — `resolve`-only: also dump the nested scope tree
- `--trace` — stream per-phase timing (lex/parse/resolve/check/lint) to stderr;
  applies to `tokens`, `parse`, `resolve`, `check`, `typecheck`, `lint`
- `--explain` — after diagnostics, append the `osty explain CODE` text for each
  unique code; applies to `check`, `typecheck`, `resolve`, `lint`, `parse`, `tokens`

`fmt`-specific flags (after the subcommand):

- `--check` — exit 1 if the file is not already formatted; show diff
- `--write` — rewrite the file in place instead of printing

`gen`-specific flags (after the subcommand):

- `-o PATH` / `--out PATH` — write Go source to `PATH` instead of stdout
- `--package NAME` — Go package clause for the emitted file (default: `main`)

### Debugging build / run / test failures

`osty gen`, `osty build`, `osty run`, and `osty test` keep the generated
Go inspectable. Emitted Go now includes comments like:

```go
// Osty: /path/to/main.osty:12:5
```

When `go build`, `go run`, or the test harness fails after the Osty
front-end has succeeded, the CLI prints a short post-mortem:

- the generated Go file or scratch directory to inspect;
- the nearest Osty source marker for Go compile errors and panic stack traces;
- a category for common Go-side failures such as `package/import`,
  `transpile output`, `generated Go type/check`, or `runtime panic`;
- the exact Go command to rerun from the generated output directory.

For package/import errors, start with the reported `use go "..."` path
or project dependency configuration. For runtime panics, read the Go
stack trace above the summary and use the mapped Osty line as the first
source location to inspect.

`new` / `init`-specific flags (after the subcommand):

- `--bin` — scaffold a binary project (default): `main.osty` with `fn main`
- `--lib` — scaffold a library project: `lib.osty` with a `pub fn` starter,
  no binary entry point
- `--workspace` — scaffold a virtual workspace with one default member
  (`init` only — combined with `--member NAME` to pick the member directory)
- `--name NAME` — `init`-only: override the project name (defaults to the
  current directory basename)

The scaffolded layout is three files (`osty.toml`, the source file, and
`.gitignore`) in a new directory named after `NAME`. The manifest pins
the current spec edition; `osty new` never overwrites an existing
directory. `osty init` writes into the current directory instead of
creating a new one.

`build` / `run` / `test` / `add` / `update` / `fetch`-specific flags
(after the subcommand):

- `--offline` — do not fetch dependencies; fail if caches are missing.
- `--locked` — refuse to overwrite `osty.lock`; the resolve must match
  the existing pins exactly. Intended for CI ("did the contributor
  forget to commit the lockfile?").
- `--frozen` — implies `--locked` and `--offline`, and additionally
  requires `osty.lock` to already exist. Catches "fresh checkout, no
  lockfile" mistakes before any download starts.

`osty build` loads `osty.toml` starting at the given path (or the cwd),
resolves dependencies against `osty.lock` (regenerated if stale),
vendors deps into `<project>/.osty/deps/`, and runs the front-end
(parse → resolve → check → lint) plus gen Phase 1 across every package
the manifest names. Future iterations will invoke `go build` on the
emitted source; today step emits the Go into `<project>/.osty/out/`
and reports diagnostics.

`add`-specific flags (after the subcommand):

- `--path DIR` — local-path dependency (no network). Not combined with
  a positional name; the dir basename becomes the local alias unless
  `--rename` overrides it.
- `--git URL` — git dependency; combine with `--tag REF`, `--branch
  REF`, or `--rev SHA` to pin. Defaults to the repository's HEAD.
- `--version REQ` — registry version requirement (e.g. `^1.0`); also
  accepted as `NAME@REQ` in the positional form.
- `--dev` — add to `[dev-dependencies]` instead of `[dependencies]`.
- `--rename NAME` — override the local alias (what `use <alias>`
  refers to).

`publish`-specific flags (after the subcommand):

- `--registry NAME` — target registry (defaults to `[registries.""]`
  or the built-in default URL).
- `--token T` — API token; also read from `$OSTY_PUBLISH_TOKEN`,
  the token recorded under `[registries.<name>]`, or
  `~/.osty/credentials.toml` (set via `osty login`).
- `--dry-run` — build the tarball into `<project>/.osty/publish/`
  but do not upload.

`yank` / `unyank`-specific flags (after the subcommand):

- `--version V` — the version to flag (required).
- `--registry NAME` — target registry (defaults to the package's
  default registry).
- `--token T` — API token (same fallback chain as `publish`).

The package name is taken from `[package].name` in the local
`osty.toml`; pass an explicit `PACKAGE_NAME` positional to operate on
a different package without leaving its directory.

`search`-specific flags (after the subcommand):

- `--registry NAME` — registry to query (defaults to the project's
  default, or the built-in one when run outside a project).
- `--limit N` — maximum hits to display (default 20; pass 0 for the
  registry's own default page size).

`registry serve`-specific flags (after the subcommand):

- `--addr HOST:PORT` — address to listen on (default `127.0.0.1:7878`).
- `--root DIR` — package index/tarball storage root (default
  `.osty/registry`).
- `--token T` — bearer token required for `publish`, `yank`, and
  `unyank`; defaults to `$OSTY_REGISTRY_TOKEN`.
- `--allow-anonymous-writes` — local-test escape hatch when no token
  should be required.
- `--max-upload-mb N` — maximum package tarball size.

`login` / `logout`-specific flags (after the subcommand):

- `--registry NAME` — which registry the token belongs to. The
  empty/default registry is stored under `default` in the on-disk
  file but addressed as `--registry ""` from the CLI.
- `--token T` — login only; supply the token directly. With no
  `--token`, login reads `$OSTY_PUBLISH_TOKEN`, then falls back to
  reading a single line from stdin (works with `echo $TOKEN | osty
  login`).
- `--all` — logout only; remove every stored token.

`remove` / `rm`-specific flags (after the subcommand):

- `--dev` — only remove from `[dev-dependencies]`.
- `--offline` — re-resolve after removal without contacting any
  registry; fail if caches are missing.

### Package-manager flow

```sh
$ osty new myapp
Created binary project "myapp" at $PWD/myapp
$ cd myapp
$ osty add ../my-shared-lib --path ../../shared
Added dependency shared 0.1.0 (path+../../shared)
$ osty build
Resolved 1 dependencies for myapp v0.1.0
  shared 0.1.0    (path+../../shared)
$ osty run
Hello, Osty!
$ osty publish --dry-run
Packed myapp-0.1.0  (612 bytes, 3a7f12c4b6f0)
Dry run: tarball at .osty/publish/myapp-0.1.0.tgz (not uploaded)
```

The manifest (`osty.toml`) declares deps; the lockfile (`osty.lock`)
pins the exact resolved versions and content hashes. Path deps are
symlinked; git deps are cloned into `~/.osty/cache/git/…` and
snapshotted per commit; registry deps are downloaded + verified
against the advertised sha256 before extraction.

### Example

```sh
$ cat demo.osty
fn main() {
    let msg = "hello, {name}"
    println(msg)
}

$ osty check demo.osty
error[E0500]: undefined name `name`
 --> demo.osty:2:24
    |
  2 |     let msg = "hello, {name}"
    |                        ^^^^ not in scope

  1 error(s), 0 warning(s)
```

## Testing

```sh
go test ./...                                           # unit tests
go test ./... -run TestSpecCodeBlocks -v                # spec markdown coverage
go test ./internal/resolve/ -run TestSpec -v            # positive + negative corpus
go test -fuzz=FuzzLex   -fuzztime=30s ./internal/lexer/
go test -fuzz=FuzzParse -fuzztime=30s ./internal/parser/
```

The **spec corpus** lives under `testdata/spec/`:

- `positive/NN-<chapter>.osty` — one fixture per spec chapter;
  `TestSpecPositiveCorpus` asserts the full pipeline emits **zero**
  diagnostics for each.
- `negative/reject.osty` — a bundled file of `// === CASE: Exxxx ===`
  blocks; `TestSpecNegativeCorpus` extracts each block and asserts the
  declared diagnostic code fires.

### Golden snapshot updates

Diagnostic-rendering tests compare output to files under
`internal/diag/testdata/golden/`. When you intentionally change the
format:

```sh
go test ./internal/diag/ -run TestGolden -update
git diff internal/diag/testdata/golden/
```

## Architecture notes

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the pass-level design,
error-recovery strategy, and how diagnostics flow through the pipeline.
The diagnostic catalogue is in [`ERROR_CODES.md`](./ERROR_CODES.md) —
generated from the doc comments on the `CodeXxx` constants in
`internal/diag/codes.go`. Regenerate with `go generate
./internal/diag/...`. CI runs `go run ./cmd/codesdoc -in
internal/diag/codes.go -check ERROR_CODES.md` to catch missed
regenerations.

## Contributing

The current baseline is **v0.3** (`LANG_SPEC_v0.3/`, `OSTY_GRAMMAR_v0.3.md`).
v0.3 closed every previously-open gap; new findings are tracked in
[`SPEC_GAPS.md`](./SPEC_GAPS.md). The compiler follows spec decisions
literally — if a construct "should" work but doesn't, verify it against
the grammar first.

Conventions:
- Every new error site gets a stable `Exxxx` code in
  `internal/diag/codes.go` and a focused test that asserts the code.
- Fuzz regressions must be added to the corresponding corpus.
- No `panic` outside of programmer-error paths (nil map, impossible
  enum case) — lexer and parser recover gracefully.
